  <h1>who am i</h1>
  <br>
  <p>i am a russian developer with 4 years of experience in luau, as i am writing this i am learning assembly and c. i play all sorts of games, but mostly i like building games. i made this website to store stuff from games and other places, there is one thing i can say for sure after i made this website: html is bad. at first sight you might think that html is simple but it isnt, there were a ton of weird issues i had to fix, you could use html if you want but in the end of the day its your choice what you use. </p>
